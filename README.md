# Saral Lekha Mobile Application
Women’s access to finance is a complex issue in Nepal. Government of Nepal has given directive to commercial banks to provide women entrepreneurs with collateral free subsidized loan of up to NPR 1.5 million. Commercial banks are also required to disburse agriculture loan equivalent to 10% of their total loan portfolio. However, this loan can only be accessed by women registered as sole proprietorship and require sound business/production plan.

Rural women farmers of Nepal are not well versed in formal financial dealings. Saral Lekha app will help women develop production plan and record the expenses. The financial projection and report generated will be used by bank as evidence of cash-flow for granting loan.

The data collected from this app can be used as open privacy protected data with location wise information on women farmer’s loan accessibility; utilization of loan on different agriculture equipment and inputs; revenue; profits; loan repayment; insurance.
